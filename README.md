# ddrumPlus-utils

A simple set of tools to build EPROM sample images for the Clavia ddrum Plus! drum synthesizer

Tools :
  - ddrumff : the ddrum File Formater, takes a .wav file and outputs a binary file you have to "pack" with ddrumimg
  - ddrumimg :  the ddrum image builder, takes four ddrum binary files and "packs" them into an EPROM image
